## CCWIG -> C Compiler Written in Go

> I am starting this project on 2024-08-28 
> The Code will be written on a Raspberry pi zero 2W 
> Just to maybe challange myself and prove that a complex level project can be made in simplest machine (Cost of a raspberry pi zero 2 W at this time in india is around 1.5k rupees or roughly 15 dollars)
